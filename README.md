CRYSTAL COLLECTOR- UNIT 4 GAME.

In this assignment, A fun and interactive game call Crystal Collector has created in the web browsers.   In this game the player 
have to guess numbers. This is how this game works:


   1. There are four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

   2. The player is shown a random number at the start of the game.

   3. When the player clicks on a crystal, it adds a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

     * The game hides this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
     * When the player clicks one, the score counter is updated.

   4. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   5. The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   6. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

     * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new 
       hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

   7. The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to 
      restart the game.
